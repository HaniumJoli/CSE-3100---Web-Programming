                <h2>Mother of humanity</h2>
                <p><b>Mother Teresa</b>   is a humanitarian who is well-known throughout the world for her selfless approach toward those who are in need. She was born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, Macedonia. She became a nun at the age of 18 and moved to India. She began teaching geography at St. Mary’s Convent School in Calcutta. She could not bear to see the sorrows, pains, and difficulties of those around her, so she dedicated the remainder of her life to serving the poor and oppressed. In Calcutta, she founded the Missionaries of Charity and Nirmal Hriday, a shelter for the poor. Many other branches were opened in Asia, Africa and Latin America. She also opened schools and hospitals. She loved children the most and loved to teach the students. There are a lot of schools that provide free education to the poorest of the poor. She also started an open-air school to teach the students without taking any money.  She chose to live a modest life which drew people from all over the world to volunteer and serve the destitute.  She was dearly called ‘Mother’.  She was honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize and the Bharat Ratna for her outstanding service. Even years after she died, she still is a great role model to all who know her.</p>
